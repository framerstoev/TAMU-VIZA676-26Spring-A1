# Reflection: How AI Helped Me

Working on this assignment, AI acted like a practical assistant and a thinking partner. It helped me turn a vague idea (“a matrix view with sparklines and interaction”) into a concrete plan, then into working code with a clear structure. When I got stuck, AI didn’t just give an answer—it helped me debug step by step, interpret error messages, and understand what the tools were doing (especially with Bokeh callbacks, notebook-to-HTML export, and Git/GitHub workflows).

AI also improved my design decisions. It pushed me to be explicit about requirements (axes, encoding, tooltip, legend, interaction mode) and to think about readability and maintainability, not just “making it work.” That made my notebook cleaner and easier to explain.

At the same time, I learned I still need to verify outputs and make choices myself—AI accelerates iteration, but I’m responsible for correctness, clarity, and whether the final result actually answers the user’s questions. Overall, it saved time, reduced frustration, and helped me learn faster by turning each block into an actionable next step.
